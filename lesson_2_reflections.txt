What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You may also wish to run git status after you have created the file. You should see that now both files are listed as untracked files.

When you've created and updated your reflections document for lesson 2, click "Next."

hquach (master #) reflections $ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	lesson_1_reflections.txt
	lesson_2_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
hquach (master #) reflections $ 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
